# WeatherApp

WeatherApp is a Java application that I developed by following a tutorial. My goal was to practice mi Java skills and become familiar with project structure and the process of developing a real, functional application from scratch.
By simply entering the name of a city, the app retrieves real-time wheather data. As an additional feature beyond the tutorial, I implemented automatic detection of the user's current location when the application launches (similar to how modern weather app behaves) and made several small adjustments to improve the overall user experience.
The project uses the Java Swing framework for the front-end and communicates with three different APIs. It is still a work in progress: I plan to experiment with other front-end frameworks, since Swing is somewhat outdated, and further refine the back-end.
